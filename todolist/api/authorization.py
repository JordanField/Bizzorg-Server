    The group item Authorization class denotes how auxilliary group objects
    (To-do list items, schedule events) can be viewed and who can view and
    edit them. The main procedure is to allow all members of the group to view
    items for that group, but only group admins should be allowed to create
    and edit items. Only VIP staff are able to delete items.
